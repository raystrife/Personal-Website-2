					<h3>Automation Testing</h3>
					<p>Since I begin my career as a quality analyst, I realize the value of automation testing. Having one ready will save much time and will be more efficient in catching regression bugs. Just like most people, my first automation tool is Selenium, which I used to test my personal website. This gives me much experience to use Playwright to automate regression test for Local Line's e-commerce platform.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="service">
					<h3>Testing & Troubleshooting</h3>
					<p>Other than automation testing, my other responsibility is to write a test plan and to perform a manual test for a new feature. With my thorough testing, I'm able to catch most major bugs and reduce the number of high-priority bugs after release. Additionally, I have experience in debugging for the source of the bug by looking at the network/console errors and investigate the cause on the codebase.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="service">
					<h3>Software Development</h3>
					<p>I learned a lot of software development during my internships while I was studying at University of Waterloo. I'm able to use my internship experience to help the development team at Local Line to fix bugs and develop new feature for our app. For fun, I would use what I learned at internship, work, and university to develop my own app as side projects. Please take a look at my Chess Project and Chatroom App!</p>

					<h3 class="my-journey__company">Local Line</h3>
					<p class="my-journey__title">QA Analyst, since Nov 2020</p>
					<p class="my-journey__location">Kitchener, ON</p>
					<p class="my-journey__desc">When I first joined Local Line, there were a lot of on-fire bug that are caught after release. This led the developer team to spend unnecessary time to fix bug and reduce their productivity. Through my detailed manual testing, I'm able to reduce the number of on-fire bugs by 80%. Additionally, I was able to create an automation test with Playwright that reduces the time spent on running manual regression test. By working with the developers, I was able to develop a test environment that is deployed for each pull request, which reduces the cost of hosting the test environment and speeds up time spent on testing.</p>

					<p class="my-journey__title">Test Automation, Jan 2019 - Apr 2019</p>
					<p class="my-journey__location">Waterloo, ON</p>
					<p class="my-journey__desc">During my internship at Christie Digital, I was able to use everything I've learned during my internship and study to good use. I was able to contribute to the company by developing a tool with Python that queries the status of Christie's projectors periodically. Additionally, I designed the UI for the tool by using Qt so that it will be easier to use by my teammates. By working with my teammates, I was able to learn the importance of automation testing. This inspired me to pursue the career in automation testing development for my full-time job.</p>

					<p class="my-journey__title">Software Developer, May 2018 - Aug 2018</p>
					<p class="my-journey__location">Ottawa, ON</p>
					<p class="my-journey__desc">Klashwerks develops Raven, which is a device that tracks the status of the user's vehicle. It is my pleasure to contribute to the development of the product by writing unit test, integration test, and regresssion test. The last test is definitely the most memorable one for me as I'm using Robot Framework to maintain the correct compability of the product and the vehicle's on-board diagnostic. This compability will allow Klashwer's product to track the vehicle's status and inform it to the user.</p>

					<p class="my-journey__desc">My internship at Peraso Technologies is definitely one of my most memorable experience. I learned a lot from my tasks and my teammates, especially in regard to scripting and agile development process. It's also interesting to learn more about 60Ghz wifi that is being developed by the company. In the end, I was able to use everything I learned to develop a test script to emulate a long-distance signal travel by using 60G attenuator.</p>

					<p class="my-journey__location">Waterloo, ON</p>
					<p class="my-journey__desc">I enrolled in the University of Waterloo in order to study mathematical economics. During my first year, I was able to enroll in several computer science courses. Then, I realized that I love to see people use my app and find it helpful in their daily life. Even though I was enrolled in the Mathematical Economics program, I still tried my best to study software development both from the university and from online courses. My hardwork gives me an opportunity to land internships with various software companies in order to gain more experience in software development.</p>
