					<h3>Automation Testing</h3>
					<p>Having an automation test ready will save so much time and will be more efficient in catching regression bugs. Based on my experience, running an automated regression test for a whole app can reduce the time spent by 95% compared to running a manual one. Currently, my favourite automation test framework is Playwright, whose built-in methods will wait for the target element to show up on the web page.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="service">
					<h3>Testing & Troubleshooting</h3>
					<p>Before I can work on automation testing, I have to start by writing a test plan and performing a manual test for a new feature. With my thorough testing, I'm able to catch most major bugs and reduce the number of high-priority bugs after release. When I have the opportunity, I'm also involved in debugging and troubleshooting the bug by analyzing the errors and investigating the cause on the codebase.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="service">
					<h3>Software Development</h3>
					<p>I first learned about software development during my internships while I was studying at the University of Waterloo. I'm able to use those experience to assist the development team at Local Line to fix bugs and develop new features for our app. For fun, I would use what I learned to develop my own app as a side project. Please take a look at my Chess Project and Chatroom App!</p>

					<img src="img/logo/local-line-logo.jpg" alt="Local Line logo" class="my-journey__logo">
					<h3 class="my-journey__company">Local Line</h3>
					<p class="my-journey__title">QA Analyst, since Nov 2020</p>
					<p class="my-journey__location">Kitchener, ON</p>
					<p class="my-journey__desc">When I first joined Local Line, my first objective was to reduce the number of on-fire bugs that were caught after release. This caused the developer team to spend unnecessary time to fix bug, which reduces their productivity. Through my rigorous manual testing, I was able to reduce the number of on-fire bugs by about 80%. Additionally, my automation test with Playwright further reduces the time spent on running manual regression test. By working with the developers, we were able to develop a compact test environment that is deployed for each pull request, which reduces the cost of hosting these  environments and speeds up the testing process.</p>

					<p class="my-journey__title">Test Automation, Jan 2019 - Apr 2019</p>
					<p class="my-journey__location">Waterloo, ON</p>
					<p class="my-journey__desc">During my internship at Christie Digital, I was able to use everything I had learned during my past internships to good use. My favourite project involved the development of a tool with Python that periodically queries the status of Christie's projectors. To make the tool easier to use by my teammates, I designed the UI for the tool by using Qt framework. In the end, my internship at Christie Digital inspired me to pursue a career in the automation testing development for my full-time job.</p>

					<p class="my-journey__title">Software Developer, May 2018 - Aug 2018</p>
					<p class="my-journey__location">Ottawa, ON</p>
					<p class="my-journey__desc">Klashwerks develops Raven, which is a device that tracks and reports the status of the user's vehicle. During my internship there, I was able to contribute to the development of the product by writing unit tests, integration tests, and regresssion tests. The development of the regression test was definitely my most memorable project since I was able to use Robot Framework to maintain the correct compability of Raven and the vehicle's on-board diagnostic. This compability will allow Raven to track the vehicle's status and inform it to the user.</p>

					<p class="my-journey__title">Software Engineer, Apr 2017 - Dec 2017</p>
					<p class="my-journey__location">Toronto, ON</p>
					<p class="my-journey__desc">My internship at Peraso Technologies is definitely one of my most memorable experience. Since I didn't have any experience in software development, I used this opportunity to learn from my tasks and my teammates, especially in regard to scripting and the Agile development process. This was also an interesting opportunity to learn about the 60Ghz wifi that is being developed by the company. In the end, I was able to use everything I learned to develop a test script that emulates a long-distance signal travel by using a 60G attenuator.</p>

					<p class="my-journey__title">Bachelor of Mathematical Economics, Sep 2014 - Apr 2020</p>
					<p class="my-journey__location">Waterloo, ON</p>
					<p class="my-journey__desc">I was enrolled in the University of Waterloo to study mathematical economics. During my first year, I was able to enroll in several computer science courses, which led me to realize how much I love to see people find my app helpful in their daily life. Thus, even though I was studying mathematical economics, I tried my best to study software development from the university and online courses. My hardwork gave me opportunities to land internships with various software companies in order to gain more experience in software development.</p>
